# To-do items

Your deliverables (modeling benefits, list of strategies + related examples, informal overview of project)

- [ ] finished the diagram, so anywhere you have `-` maybe you can fill that in
- [ ] we need a list of “benefits” for the modeling technique, so you can piece that together.
- [ ] list of a handful of strategies as well as some descriptions of examples we can relate to in the domain model e.g.:
    - "Start by thinking through events"
    - "Figure out how to separate entities from descriptions"
- [ ] come up with two more, we’d be in good shape
- [ ] A high level overview of the system.  You have a small list of features, I’d want something along those lines but in a prose format. We need this to fill in the back story around the diagram and to give the reader an understanding of the context we’re working in.

## Tips:

- "Start with too much material, then give the reader just enough"
